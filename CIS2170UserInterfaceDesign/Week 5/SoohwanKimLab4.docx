The piano stairs project from The Fun Theory captured my attention the most. As someone who loves music and instruments, I’m drawn to the idea of creating melodies simply by walking. This not only adds a playful element to an everyday task but also promotes healthier habits by encouraging people to take the stairs. The goal of the project is to enhance public health by making stair-climbing a fun, interactive experience. 
In terms of user control and freedom, the piano steps let people move at their own pace and experiment with different rhythms. Users can choose how they engage with the steps—whether they stroll, hop, or try to compose a tune by stepping on specific notes. This freedom fosters a sense of excitement and personal agency, making the activity feel less forced and more inviting.
Additionally, the project exemplifies a match between the system and the real world, because the piano concept is immediately recognizable. People instinctively understand how piano keys work, so they know that stepping on different keys produces different sounds. By blending the familiar (piano keys) with the mundane (stairs), the design encourages users to explore and enjoy their environment.
Ultimately, the piano stairs demonstrate how creative design can transform ordinary routines into memorable and beneficial experiences.


Part 1

Physical Space – University Centre (Entrance
In my opinion, the UC could benefit from some design improvements, particularly regarding its entrance layout. While the main entrance is wide enough to accommodate a large number of people simultaneously, the entrance from the campus side often feels cramped and congested, especially during peak hours. The narrow space struggles to handle the heavy foot traffic efficiently, causing bottlenecks that can be frustrating for students trying to get to their classes on time. This issue could be alleviated by adding clear directional signs that guide people to use different entrances and exits. Encouraging the use of alternative access points would help distribute the flow of traffic more evenly, reducing crowding and making the space feel more open and organized. Additionally, subtle design changes like widening the pathway or reconfiguring the interior layout could enhance the overall movement within the UC.
Non-Physical Space – CourseLink Interface
CourseLink, the university’s online learning platform, is an essential tool for managing courses, but I believe it could be improved, especially in how it presents course outlines and important deadlines. Currently, students have to click through multiple tabs and sections to find key information like assignment due dates, quiz schedules, and discussion deadlines. This process can be time-consuming and inefficient, particularly when juggling multiple courses. A more user-friendly design would be to integrate a consolidated overview panel within each course page. For instance, displaying the course outline, along with all upcoming deadlines for assignments, quizzes, and discussions, in a sidebar on the right side of the website would make it much easier to track important dates at a glance. This streamlined approach would reduce the need to navigate through different sections, helping students stay organized and manage their workload more effectively.

Fix - 
Adding more attractions or things to do/food/drink/store in routes that are less used
so more people are over there to relieve congestion

Fix - 
- Make it easier to authenticate or remove 2FA all together
- Make the layouts of each class easier to navigate and making the classes cards more informative
- Make the information of the class more accessible and easy to find
- Fun color scheme other than white and gray
- Change the course cards to fun shapes like circles
- Add bubbly animations for buttons 
- Emojis





Noah
Physical – Alexander Hall
Problem : It is confusing to navigate because it has narrow corridors and is very dimly lit and only seems to follow one direction.

Fix – Use dynamic colors as you go inside and show levels as you go so you can feel a sense of achievement.


Virtual - Webadvisor
Problem : UI is very outdated and old. Colors of the website are dull and the features are slow.

Fix – Use dynamic colors and add more interactive animation in buttons and in overall layout.

Physical: I picked War Memorial Hall on the north side of the University of Guelph since it has several design flaws that affect accessibility and comfort. The walkways are too narrow, causing traffic for students to enter and exit. Seating is cramped, forcing students to stand when others need to pass. The attached desks are small, right-hand only and require pulling from another student's chair, invading their space. The upstairs section is worse, with some seats lacking desks entirely. Improvements such as wider walkways, better seat spacing, and universally accessible desks would help functionality of the space. 

Fix - Add desks to the upstairs section with colors or images 

Virtual: I picked CourseLink our online Brightspace tool, has several usability issues that slow down the student experience. One major issue is the frequent authentication requirement. Users must verify their login via phone every time they access the platform, and inactivity for around 30 minutes results in automatic logout, which can frustrate and disrupt the user workflow. The notification panel is also problematic, often displaying cut-off messages that make it difficult to quickly grasp important updates. Additionally, CourseLink lacks a standardized layout across courses. Professors can customize their pages, leading to inconsistencies that make it difficult for students to locate key tabs like quizzes and grades. Standardizing layouts, refining the notification system, and improving authentication convenience would greatly enhance the user experience.

Fix -
-Fix the notification panel and make it have an animation on hover



Dylan

Physical Space: I think the walk across Johnston Green could be better designed, the current walkway (in the summertime) is made up of white rocks/pebbles, sometimes making it uncomfortable to walk on depending on your footwear, and I have seen many people just walk on the grass next to the path instead. The walk could also be more aesthetically pleasing instead of just a white line across the grass, maybe add some flowers or bushes along the walkway to make the design of it less boring. 

Fix - Pave the walkway making it more accessible for pedestrians, adding more foliage to help decorate the liven up the area. Both this things will add more colour and life to the area. Making it more enjoyable to walk through.

Virtual Space: I think CourseLink could be designed better and make the content breakdown of each course more easier to read without having to search each content module to find exactly what you need, as well as logging into CourseLink with our UoG email can be tiring when we have to reauthenticate after such a short period of time, perhaps allowing us to trust certain devices could help?

Fix

-Allow adding device to authenticate automatically so the user doesn't have to constantly reauthenticate their connection. 
- Make it easier to authenticate or remove 2FA all together
- Make the layouts of each class easier to navigate and making the classes cards more informative
- Make the information of the class more accessible and easy to find
- Fun color scheme other than white and gray
- Change the course cards to fun shapes like circles
- Add bubbly animations for buttons 
- Emojis








Redesign using Fun Theory




































- We thought of painting the pathways with fun colorful things to make them more visually appealing and make people actually use the pathways instead of taking shortcuts or avoiding the paths all together.

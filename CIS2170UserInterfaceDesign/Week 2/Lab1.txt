1. Family emergency, Severe health issues

2. Teams / Slack / Discord 

3. Once a week 

4. In advance / Somewhere in between

5. I have time for everyone to review all materials before they are submitted

6. I expect the other members to be responsible for their work and I expect myself to be the same as the others.

7. I have and I helped the guy / I did the rest of his work myself.

8. Worst experience : It was a team of three people and one guy did absolutely nothing and excused that his family member was sick
for a month. 

Good experience was everyone was willing to put effort into the work and responsible for the work so there was no critical conflicts
throughout the project.
